This is a basic Qt Project, this is how to test the package:

1. Take a image file (currently just jpeg file or png file), and open it in the application.
2. Click on "Enter Point", and enter the (x,y) coordinates of the center of the local adjustment region
3. Click on "Enter Radius", and enter the inner and outer radius of the circular region with the center as the previous point.
4. Click on "Generate Crop" to make a png file of the selection, the file is saved as "Colored Circular.png" file.
5. Currently the image is edited using gimp, making all hue saturation changes (the changes can be linked later in digikam)
6. After editing the changes in gimp, the file is overwritten.
7. Click on "Attach Crop" to attach the crop back to the image.
8. The image is saved as "finalresult.png"
